# Run 7: offset inside IC loop, noise 0.1
# Run 8: offset inside IC loop, noise ~0.01
# Run 9: offset outside IC loop
# Run 10: no noise
# Run 11: logenergy reward, no noise
# Run 12: energy reward, no noise
# Run 13: d2udx2 multiplier in action (coupled burger name wrong)
# Run 0:  the real coupled burger, no noise, does it learn?
